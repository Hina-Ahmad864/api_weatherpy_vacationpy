# WeatherPy

	# Displaying the relationship between weather variables and latitude from the weatherPy data. 
	# Showcasing the following relationships:
		# Lat vs. Temp
		# Lat vs. Humidity
		# Lat vs. Cloudiness
		# Lat vs. Wind Speed
	# Showcased the Linear Regression for each relationship by create plots of: 
		# Northern Hemisphere: Temperature vs. Latitude
		# Southern Hemisphere: Temperature vs. Latitude
		# Northern Hemisphere: Humidity vs. Latitude
		# Southern Hemisphere: Humidity vs. Latitude
		# Northern Hemisphere: Cloudiness vs. Latitude
		# Southern Hemisphere: Cloudiness vs. Latitude
		# Northern Hemisphere: Wind Speed vs. Latitude
		# Southern Hemisphere: Wind Speed vs. Latitude
	# Concluded the relationships and findings per plot.

# VacationPy

	# Use Geoapify API and the gewViews Python library to create map visualizations
	# Map displays point for each city in the data frame and the size of the point varies by the humidity in each city
	# Further narrow down to find ideal weather conditions and search for hotels by using the Geoapify API located within 10,000 meters of found coordinates of 'ideal weather conditions'
	# Create points with hover information. Source for hover code: https://hvplot.holoviz.org/reference/geopandas/points.html
